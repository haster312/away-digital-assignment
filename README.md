# Project Name

Welcome to the Project Name! This guide will help you get started with running the project using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Docker**: Docker is a platform that allows you to run applications in containers. You can download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Open a Terminal**: You can find the terminal application on your computer. On Windows, you might use Command Prompt or PowerShell. On Mac, use the Terminal app.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where the project files are located. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Start the Application**: Run the following command to start the application using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This command will download any necessary components and start the application in the background. It might take a few minutes the first time you run it.

4. **Access the Application**: Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   You should see the application interface.

5. **Stopping the Application**: To stop and remove the application containers, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
   This will stop and remove the running containers.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, ensure Docker is running on your computer.
- Make sure you are in the correct directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located before running the `docker-compose up` command.
